# Contributing to AI in Motion

We welcome contributions to the AI in Motion project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this educational robotics curriculum.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
8. Open a Pull Request
