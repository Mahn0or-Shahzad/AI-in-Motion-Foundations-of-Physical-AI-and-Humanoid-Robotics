# Module 2: Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI in Motion curriculum! This module focuses on creating digital twins using Gazebo simulation and Unity visualization. You'll learn how to simulate physics, sensors, and create immersive human-robot interaction experiences.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up physics-based simulation environments in Gazebo
- Configure and simulate various sensors (LiDAR, depth camera, IMU)
- Visualize robot movements and sensor data in Unity
- Validate sensor data in simulation environments

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that can be used for simulation, analysis, and testing. In robotics, digital twins allow us to test algorithms and behaviors in a safe, controlled environment before deploying to real hardware.

## Topics Covered

- Physics simulation: gravity, collisions
- Sensors: LiDAR, depth, IMU
- Unity visualization for human-robot interaction
- Sensor data validation

Let's explore the world of digital twins!
