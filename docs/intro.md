# Introduction to AI in Motion

Welcome to AI in Motion: Foundations of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This comprehensive curriculum teaches Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics through a structured, hands-on approach. The course combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation using ROS 2, simulation environments, and AI technologies.

## What You'll Learn

In this course, you'll develop a deep understanding of:

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Master the Robot Operating System 2 for robotics development
- **Simulation Environments**: Work with Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- **AI Integration**: Implement Vision-Language-Action systems with OpenAI Whisper
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Control and navigate bipedal robots
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Move from simulation to physical robot deployment

## Course Structure

The curriculum is organized into four progressive modules plus a capstone project:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 — Robotic Nervous System**
   - Learn core ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services
   - Implement Python-based ROS 2 packages
   - Create URDF models for humanoid robots

2. **Module 2: Digital Twin — Gazebo & Unity**
   - Build physics-based simulation environments
   - Configure and simulate various sensors
   - Visualize robot movements in Unity

3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac AI-Robot Brain**
   - Utilize Isaac Sim for realistic training environments
   - Implement VSLAM algorithms using Isaac ROS
   - Configure Nav2 for bipedal robot navigation

4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**
   - Process voice commands using OpenAI Whisper API
   - Convert natural language to executable ROS 2 actions
   - Implement cognitive planning with LLMs

5. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid**
   - Integrate all previous modules into a complete system
   - Demonstrate voice-controlled humanoid navigation and manipulation
   - Apply assessment criteria for project evaluation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic programming experience in Python
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Access to appropriate hardware (see Hardware Requirements)

## Hardware Requirements

### Digital Twin Workstation (Recommended)
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB) minimum
- CPU: Intel i7 (13th Gen) or AMD Ryzen 9
- RAM: 64GB DDR5 (32GB minimum)
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### Edge AI Kit (For Physical Deployment)
- Jetson Orin Nano (8GB) or Orin NX (16GB)
- Intel RealSense D435i/D455 camera
- USB IMU (BNO055) for balance
- USB microphone/speaker array

## Getting Started

Follow the setup guide to prepare your development environment, then begin with Module 1 to build a solid foundation for the more advanced topics in later modules.
