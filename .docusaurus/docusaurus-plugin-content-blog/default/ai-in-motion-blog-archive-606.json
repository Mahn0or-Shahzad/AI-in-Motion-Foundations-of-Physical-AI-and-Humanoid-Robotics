In this post, we will guide you through setting up your first humanoid robot simulation using ROS 2 and Gazebo.\n\n**Steps to get started:**\n1. Ensure your development environment is ready (ROS 2, Gazebo, Python).\n2. Open Module 1 tutorials in the Docs section to understand basic ROS 2 nodes and topics.\n3. Run the provided simulation scripts to see your humanoid robot move.\n\nThis blog will help you get hands-on experience and complement the tutorials. Screenshots, visual guides, and tips will follow in upcoming posts. Explore, experiment, and enjoy building your first robot!"
