## Prompt

sp.plan

## Response snapshot

[Created comprehensive implementation plan for AI in Motion project including: technical context, constitution compliance check, research findings, data models, API contracts, quickstart guide, and implementation roadmap]

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed implementation plan with architecture and technical specifications
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for planning artifacts
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, and quickstart.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Task breakdown and implementation can follow
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan provides complete roadmap for project implementation with all necessary technical details
